[00:12.00] Always lighting up every room
[00:17.92] Seems so perfect from every point of view
[00:24.22] Just one look is more than enough
[00:29.68] Makes you believe in something above
[00:35.01] But not everything's always as it seems
[00:40.97] It's a different story laying beneath
[00:46.75] She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical
[00:49.75] She's forever angry at the world
[00:52.76] She's no angel, but she is my religion
[00:58.81] Always finding ways to numb the pain
[01:01.56] She's mad and she will never change
[01:04.71] She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
[01:16.96] Everybody wants to have their taste
[01:22.84] I'm no different, I am just the same
[01:28.74] But she helped me find a different kinda love
[01:34.31] Made me feel like I was finally enough
[01:40.35] But there's more going on behind the scenes
[01:45.91] She needs this love just as much as me
[01:52.28] She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical
[01:54.96] She's forever angry at the world
[01:58.05] She's no angel, but she is my religion
[02:03.95] Always finding ways to numb the pain
[02:06.89] She's mad and she will never change
[02:10.08] She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
[02:18.33] Religion, religion
[02:24.82] Religion, religion
[02:31.01] Religion, religion
[02:36.60] Religion, religion
[02:39.57] She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical
[02:42.34] She's forever angry at the world
[02:45.15] She's no angel, but she is my religion
[02:50.84] Always finding ways to numb the pain
[02:54.05] She's mad and she will never change
[02:57.23] She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
